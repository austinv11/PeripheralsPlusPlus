# RF Turtle Charger

---

The RF Turtle Charger is a block which charges up to 6 turtles at a time using RF power. The more turtles charging at a time, the slower each turtle charges. The conversion rate by default is 200rf/t per 1 fuel level in the turtle with an 80000 rf buffer. **Note**: This is only enabled when Thermal Expansion is loaded.
